# 🧭 Role of Wordmark vs Mascot

## ✅ Wordmark (the name "Dafun" stylized)

Primary logo used for:

- App header / splash screen  
- Website navbar  
- Business cards, documents  
- Loading screen  

**Purpose:** Represents the brand clearly.  
You want people to **read and remember "Dafun" at a glance**.

---

## ✅ Mascot (optional friendly character or icon)

Used where you need **fun**, **personality**, or **minimal space**:

- App icon (launcher)  
- Empty states (e.g., “No rides found”)  
- Onboarding screens  
- Social media posts / marketing  
- Stickers, shirts, etc.

> Think of the mascot as your **ambassador** — it can smile, move, and speak visually. It’s the “face” of the brand.
